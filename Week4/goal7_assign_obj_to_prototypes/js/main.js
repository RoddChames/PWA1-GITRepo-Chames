 1.)  create array with five names minimum.  These names will be randomly selected for output display. 
 ****var names = [Jose, Jim, Jack, Jill, Janet]****

 2.)  create syntax to randomly pull name from array using Math.random
 
 3.) create "for loop" which will loop three times basically giving the three people their name/job/action and placing it in the iterated row. 
 
 4.) if an name is chosen use the pop method to delete it from the array, this will prevent the name from being duplicated.
 
 5.) create a variable called person and this will contain the instantiating person object. Pass the random name and row into the parameters.
 
 6.) create a function "populateHTML" which will put the random information provided for the loop onto the screen using innerHTML property.
 
 7.) set interval to call the following function 30 times per second
 
 8.) set up the runUpdate function which contains instances of the people array. 
 
 9.) each instance will be updated 30 times per second.
